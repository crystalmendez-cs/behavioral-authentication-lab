# behavioral-authentication-lab
Exploring behavioral security and adversarial reconnaissance through ethical, lab-based analysis.
---

## Overview
This project explores how automated systems establish trust and detect adversarial behavior through contextual and behavioral indicators rather than traditional credentials.

The lab focuses on how machines probe environments to validate authenticity—mirroring real-world adversarial reconnaissance and defensive detection techniques.

## Objectives
- Analyze non-human reconnaissance behavior
- Identify behavioral indicators of automated probing
- Compare contextual validation vs credential-based trust
- Connect reconnaissance activity to defensive detection strategies

## Environment
- Kali Linux VM (adversary simulation)
- Windows VM (defender observation)
- Nmap
- Wireshark

## Methodology
Controlled reconnaissance scans were conducted in lab environments and against publicly permitted targets.  
Traffic patterns, scan timing, and service responses were observed to identify characteristics of automated behavior rather than human interaction.

## Ethical Scope
All activity was performed in controlled lab environments or against authorized public targets.  
No exploitation, payload delivery, or persistence techniques were used.

## Key Takeaway
As automated systems increasingly interact with one another, cybersecurity defenses must rely on behavioral and contextual signals to establish trust and detect adversarial activity.
